# Oracle-SQL-Sales-Transaction-Project
This project is a simulation for designing a relational database for a transaction processing system. The project was done with Oracle SQL server.
The main goal was to take a business’s unorganized data and tables to transform it into a logical and strategic relational database in which users of the company can run queries and obtain reports in the most efficient way possible.

## Overview
### [Determine business needs](https://github.com/jmt7080/Oracle-SQL-Sales-Transaction-Project/blob/master/IST302_Fall_2015_Database_Term_Project_-_Instructions.pdf)
1. Identify users of the company 
2. Identify potential sales transactions information needed for each user
### [Conceptual data modeling](https://github.com/jmt7080/Oracle-SQL-Sales-Transaction-Project/blob/master/Storage.txt)
1. Separated tables as new entities
2. Created entity relations diagram
### [Design relational database](https://github.com/jmt7080/Oracle-SQL-Sales-Transaction-Project/blob/master/TableGen.txt)
1.	Normalize data types to make sure it is all consistent and appropriate
2.	Consider and implement acceptable data integrity constraints
### [Security and testing](https://github.com/jmt7080/Oracle-SQL-Sales-Transaction-Project/blob/master/Security%20-%20Tables%20and%20BViews.txt)
1.	Assign specific privileges depending on user type and role
2.	Testing to make sure all users have appropriate accesses and denials
###	[Query Optimization](https://github.com/jmt7080/Oracle-SQL-Sales-Transaction-Project/blob/master/Syntax%20for%20BV%20Queries%2C%20indexes%2C%20MViews.txt)
1.	Query cost testing based on user’s potential reports
2.	Implement indexes and views to ensure lower running costs
